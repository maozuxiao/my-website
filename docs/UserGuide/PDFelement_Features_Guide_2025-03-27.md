## Split view

Split View is a feature that lets you view a PDF in two different panels. You can use this to view information from two non-consecutive pages at once. Scrolling on one panel will not affect the display on the other panel.

- Open a PDF, then click "View"> the "Reading Mode" button between "Zoom" and "Background."
