# How to log in to C39B WebGUI

## Background

> [!CAUTION]
>
> C39B WebGUI is developed based on IE browser. Microsoft Windows 11 has removed IE browser. You need to use the following method to access C39B WebGUI

## Pre-Condition

1. Download the [plug-ins](https://maozuxiao.github.io/my-website/assets/plug-ins.rar)  

2. install ==General/ie.exe==

   > If you cannot access the live view interface and are using a computer with integrated graphics, please install ==Integrated graphics version/ie_20241023.exe==

## Steps

1. When using the Edge browser to access the IPC interface, there will be no login button (where Edit 1 is located). If the browser does not have the IE icon where Mark 2 is located, you need to do the following. If so, you need to click the icon to switch to IE mode.
